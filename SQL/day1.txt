Holding place for queries I may want to do

Problems:
1. names of courses in descending alphabetical order

SELECT name FROM courses ORDER BY name DESC;

2. List names of teachers who's ID is greater than 5000

SELECT name FROM teachers WHERE teachers.id > 5000;

3. List names of all courses that Ms. K teaches

SELECT courses.name, teachers.name FROM courses JOIN teachers ON teachers.id = courses.teacher_id WHERE courses.teacher_id = 1234;

4. List bart's grades in his classes and class names

SELECT students.name, courses.name, grades.grade FROM students
JOIN grades ON grades.student_id = students.id
JOIN courses ON courses.id = grades.course_id
WHERE students.name = "Bart";

5. list names of all students Ms. K teaches and which classes. Differentiate the column names too
